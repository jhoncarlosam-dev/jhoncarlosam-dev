- ⚡ Fun fact:  The first computer "bug" was literally a bug - a moth found trapped in a Harvard computer relay in 1947 by Grace Hopper. She taped it to her logbook with the note "First actual case of bug being found."🐞![HornetHandlingGIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e68fb057-3c5d-43d2-ab55-78323e5cabce)
